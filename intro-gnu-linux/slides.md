# Linux and the GNU System

From smartphones to cars, home desktops to enterprise services, we hear that "Linux" is everywhere.

Many of its users are not aware that is is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

# Is there really a Linux?

Yes, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.

Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run.

The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system.

Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system.

# What is GNU?

Having a *kernel* will not be enough to spin up a full operating system.

GNU Project provides several different pieces:

- *Bootloader* - The software that manages the boot process of your computer. For most users, this will be a splash screen that pops up and eventually goes away to boot into the operating system.
- *Init system* - This is a sub-system that bootstrap the user space and control daemons. 
- *Graphical server* - This is a sub-system that displays the graphics on your monitor. It is commonly referred to as the X server or just X.
- *Desktop environment* - This is the piece that the users actually intereact with. It's the user interface for interacting with applications (such as file managers, web browsers, and games)

# Why use GNU/Linux?

Does the operation system you're using really work "just fine"? Or, do you find yourself battling obstacles like viruses, malware, slow downs, crashes, costly repairs, and licensing fees?

GNU/Linux might be the perfect platform for you, and it has a zero cost of entry.
